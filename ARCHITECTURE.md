# APEX Architecture Overview

## What APEX Really Is

APEX is an **AI orchestration system** that automates software development by coordinating multiple Claude Code instances through a shared memory system. Think of it as a "conductor" that directs specialized AI "musicians" to create software symphonies.

## The Core Problem APEX Solves

**Traditional AI Development Challenge**: Single AI agents get overwhelmed with complex projects, lose context, or produce inconsistent results.

**APEX Solution**: Break down complex development goals into discrete tasks and assign them to specialized AI workers that collaborate through shared memory.

## Core Components Explained

### 1. The Supervisor (The Brain)
- **What it is**: A persistent Python process that acts as the project manager
- **What it does**:
  - Analyzes user goals and breaks them into 3-5 concrete tasks
  - Creates detailed task specifications (TaskBriefings)
  - Spawns Claude Code workers to execute tasks
  - Monitors progress and integrates results
- **Why it matters**: Provides consistent project vision and coordination

### 2. Shared Memory (The Communication Hub)
- **What it is**: An LMDB database that serves as the project's "shared brain"
- **What it stores**:
  - Task specifications and status
  - Code artifacts and documentation
  - Agent communication logs
  - Project configuration and state
- **Why it's powerful**: Enables seamless coordination without complex message passing

### 3. Ephemeral Workers (The Specialists)
- **What they are**: Short-lived Claude Code processes that execute single tasks
- **How they work**:
  - Receive minimal prompts pointing to task details in shared memory
  - Read their assignments from LMDB using MCP tools
  - Execute the task and write results back to shared memory
  - Terminate after completion
- **Key roles**:
  - **Coder**: Implements features, writes clean code
  - **Adversary**: Tests, reviews, finds vulnerabilities
  - **Custom roles**: Specialized for specific project needs

### 4. MCP Integration (The Communication Protocol)
- **What it is**: Model Context Protocol tools that let Claude Code instances interact with LMDB
- **Key tools**:
  - `apex_lmdb_read/write` - Basic memory operations
  - `apex_project_status` - Project overview
  - `apex_lmdb_scan` - Data exploration
- **Why it works**: Provides secure, controlled access to shared state

## The APEX Workflow

### Step 1: Goal Analysis
```
User: "Implement user authentication"
Supervisor: Analyzes → "This is an implementation goal"
```

### Step 2: Task Planning
```
Supervisor creates sequence:
1. Research authentication approaches (Coder, 30min)
2. Implement core auth system (Coder, 90min)
3. Test and validate security (Adversary, 45min)
```

### Step 3: Worker Orchestration
```
For each task:
- Supervisor writes TaskBriefing to LMDB
- Spawns appropriate worker with minimal prompt
- Worker reads briefing, executes task, writes results
- Supervisor validates completion and moves to next task
```

### Step 4: Integration and Completion
```
Supervisor:
- Collects all deliverables
- Validates overall goal completion
- Reports results to user
```

## Key Architectural Principles

### 1. Orchestration over Conversation
Instead of having AI agents chat with each other (which can become chaotic), APEX uses a central coordinator that gives clear, specific instructions to specialized workers.

### 2. Ephemeral Workers
Workers are "born" for a single task and "die" when complete. This prevents context pollution and ensures each task gets fresh attention.

### 3. Shared Memory as Truth
All project state lives in LMDB. Workers don't need to remember anything - they just read their current assignment and execute it.

### 4. Template-Based Simplicity
Instead of complex AI planning, APEX uses simple templates:
- "Implement X" → Research → Build → Test
- "Fix Y" → Investigate → Fix → Verify
- "Analyze Z" → Study → Implement → Review

## What Makes APEX Different

### Traditional Multi-Agent Systems:
- Agents have persistent memory and personalities
- Complex conversation protocols
- Emergent behavior that's hard to predict
- High token costs from repeated context

### APEX Approach:
- Single persistent supervisor with ephemeral workers
- Clear task specifications with shared memory
- Predictable workflows with measurable outcomes
- Efficient token usage through context-as-a-service

## Real-World Example

**Goal**: "Create a REST API for task management"

**APEX Process**:
1. **Supervisor** analyzes goal → "Implementation project for web API"
2. **Task Planning**:
   - Task 1: Research FastAPI patterns and design API structure (Coder)
   - Task 2: Implement core CRUD endpoints (Coder)
   - Task 3: Add authentication and validation (Coder)
   - Task 4: Write comprehensive tests (Adversary)
   - Task 5: Security review and performance testing (Adversary)

3. **Execution**: Workers execute sequentially, each building on the previous work stored in shared memory

4. **Result**: Complete, tested REST API with documentation
