## 1. Introduction: Simple, Effective AI Orchestration

APEX v2.0 implements a **simplified Orchestrator-Worker architecture** that focuses on practical AI development automation. Instead of complex multi-agent conversations, APEX uses a single intelligent **Supervisor** that breaks down goals into discrete tasks and orchestrates **ephemeral Workers** to execute them.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Simple but Powerful**: 3-5 task workflows instead of complex dependency graphs
- **Cost Effective**: Workers are spawned only when needed and terminated after completion
- **Transparent**: Full audit trail of all orchestration decisions and task execution
- **Reliable**: Deterministic task planning with well-defined dependencies

**The APEX Philosophy:** One persistent orchestrator managing ephemeral, specialized workers through a shared memory system. This creates maximum control and efficiency while remaining simple to understand and maintain.

## 2. Core Architectural Principles

Every design decision in APEX must align with these four principles:

1.  **Orchestration over Emulation:** We do not emulate a human team. We build an AI-native control plane where a central intelligence directs specialized executors. This is more efficient and less prone to the "emergent chaos" of multi-agent conversations.
2.  **Intelligent Dispatch:** The `Supervisor` is a smart dispatcher. It must know when a task requires creative reasoning (and invoke an expensive, intelligent `Worker`) versus when it needs a reliable, deterministic action (and invoke a cheap, fast `Utility`).
3.  **Context-as-a-Service (The LMDB Moat):** The LLM's context window is a precious, expensive resource. We protect it fiercely. Large data blobs (files, logs, web pages) *never* enter the main agent's context. Instead, they are stored in our `LMDB` database, and agents operate on *pointers* (keys) to this data. This is our core technical advantage.
4.  **Tiered Execution & Security:** The system is built in layers of trust and capability. The `Supervisor` has the highest-level view. `Intelligent Workers` are sandboxed and can only interact with the world via the `MCP Server`. `Deterministic Utilities` have more direct system access but are not creative, minimizing risk.

## 3. System Components

The APEX system consists of three distinct tiers of execution, all coordinated around a central "world state."

    end
```

## 4. The Core Orchestration Loop

The `Supervisor` is the engine of APEX. Its operation follows a continuous, five-stage loop for every task it undertakes:

1.  **PLAN:** The `Supervisor` analyzes the user's goal and creates a simple task sequence (3-5 tasks) using template-based logic:
    - **Implementation goals** ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test
    - **Bug fix goals** ‚Üí Investigate ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Verify
    - **Generic goals** ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Review

2.  **CONSTRUCT:** For each task, the `Supervisor` creates a `TaskBriefing` with:
    - Clear objective and role assignment (Coder or Adversary)
    - Context pointers to relevant LMDB data
    - Required deliverable specifications
    - Quality criteria for completion

3.  **INVOKE:** The `Supervisor` spawns Claude CLI workers with minimal prompts:
    ```bash
    claude -p "You are a {role} worker. Read your briefing from LMDB key {briefing_key} and complete the task."
    ```

4.  **MONITOR:** Real-time monitoring of worker stdout/stderr with stream-json parsing for transparency.

5.  **INTEGRATE:** Validate deliverables, mark tasks complete, and proceed to the next task in sequence.

## 5. Component Deep Dive

### 5.1 The `Supervisor` (Persistent Meta-Agent)

*   **What it is:** The single, long-running process that manages the entire project lifecycle. It is the only component the user directly interacts with.
*   **Implementation:** A Python process that orchestrates `claude` CLI sub-processes. Its own reasoning is powered by a high-capability model (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet).
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Interpreting user commands from the TUI.
    *   Maintaining the high-level project plan and task graph.
    *   Constructing `TaskBriefing` documents for workers.
    *   Dispatching tasks to the correct `Worker` or `Utility`.
    *   Managing the overall state of the `LMDB World State`.
    *   Reporting progress and results back to the user in the TUI.

### 5.2 `Coder` & `Adversary` (Ephemeral Intelligent Workers)

*   **What they are:** Temporary, single-use `claude` CLI processes invoked by the `Supervisor` to perform complex, creative, or reasoning-intensive tasks. They are "born" for a single task and "die" upon its completion.
*   **Implementation:** A standard `claude` CLI invocation.
    ```bash
    # Supervisor invokes the Coder for task-007
    claude \
      -p "You are an expert CODER agent. Your mission is to execute a single, well-defined task. Read your complete briefing from the APEX shared memory at LMDB key '/tasks/briefings/task-007' using the 'mcp__lmdb__read' tool. Follow the instructions precisely. Place your deliverables in the specified output keys. Announce 'TASK COMPLETE' when finished." \
      --output-format stream-json
    ```
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Stateless:** They have no memory of past tasks. All context comes from the `TaskBriefing`.
    *   **Sandboxed:** Their only "view" of the world is through the tools exposed by the `MCP Server`. They cannot access the file system or external APIs directly.
    *   **Efficient:** The invocation prompt is tiny. The heavy context lives in LMDB, saving significant token costs on every call.

### 5.3 `Archivist` & other Utilities (Deterministic System Utilities)

*   **What they are:** Plain Python scripts that perform specific, predictable, non-reasoning tasks. They are the "power tools" of the `Supervisor`.
*   **Implementation:** A Python script run via a sub-process, with arguments supplied by the `Supervisor`.

    ```python
    # A simplified view of apex/tools/archivist.py
    import anthropic, lmdb, argparse

    def run_archivist(source_key, target_key, model):
        # 1. Connect directly to LMDB
        db_env = lmdb.open(os.environ["APEX_LMDB_PATH"])
        content = db_env.get(source_key.encode())

        # 2. Call the LLM API directly for a specific task
        client = anthropic.Anthropic()
        message = client.messages.create(
            model=model,
            system="You are an Archivist. Summarize the following content.",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": content.decode()}]
        )
        summary = message.content[0].text

        # 3. Write the result directly back to LMDB
        db_env.put(target_key.encode(), summary.encode())
        print(f"Summary saved to {target_key}")

    # ... main function with argparse ...
    ```
*   **Key Characteristics:**
    *   **Deterministic & Reliable:** They perform their task the same way every time.
    *   **Privileged Access:** They have direct access to the system (LMDB, file system, APIs) as needed. This is safe because their logic is hard-coded and not subject to LLM "hallucinations."
    *   **Fast & Cheap:** They avoid the overhead of a full `claude` CLI session and can use cheaper, faster models for tasks like summarization.

## 6. Simplified Implementation

### TaskBriefing Structure

The `TaskBriefing` serves as the communication protocol between Supervisor and Workers:

```json
{
  "task_id": "task-20250625-1400-implement",
  "role_required": "Coder",
  "objective": "Implement user authentication system",
  "priority": "high",
  "context_pointers": {
    "project_config": "/projects/proj-001/config",
    "coding_standards": "/projects/proj-001/docs/coding_standards.md"
  },
  "deliverables": [
    {
      "type": "code",
      "description": "Authentication implementation",
      "output_key": "/tasks/outputs/task-001/code/",
      "required": true
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": ["task-20250625-1400-research"],
  "estimated_duration": 90,
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### Simple Task Templates

**Implementation Tasks**: Research ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test
```
1. Research and plan approach (Coder, 30min)
2. Implement core functionality (Coder, 90min)
3. Test and validate implementation (Adversary, 45min)
```

**Bug Fix Tasks**: Investigate ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Verify
```
1. Investigate and reproduce issue (Adversary, 30min)
2. Implement fix (Coder, 60min)
3. Verify fix and test for regressions (Adversary, 30min)
```

### Worker Communication

Workers receive minimal prompts:
```bash
claude -p "You are a {role} worker. Read your briefing from LMDB key {briefing_key} using mcp__lmdb__read. Complete the task and output deliverables to the specified keys."
```

This simplified approach provides:
- **Clarity**: Each task has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Reliability**: Sequential execution eliminates complex dependency issues
- **Efficiency**: Template-based planning reduces token usage
- **Maintainability**: Simple logic is easier to debug and extend
