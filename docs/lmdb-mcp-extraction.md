# LMDB-MCP Package Extraction

## Overview

The LMDB-MCP functionality has been successfully extracted from APEX into a standalone, reusable package that can be published to PyPI.

## What Was Done

### 1. Package Structure
Created a complete Python package structure in `/lmdb-mcp/`:
- `src/lmdb_mcp/core.py` - Core LMDB wrapper functionality
- `src/lmdb_mcp/server.py` - MCP server implementation
- `src/lmdb_mcp/__main__.py` - CLI entry point
- Complete test suite in `tests/`
- Documentation and configuration files

### 2. Code Separation
- **Moved to lmdb-mcp**: Pure LMDB operations and MCP server implementation
- **Kept in APEX**: All business logic, memory patterns, and APEX-specific functionality

### 3. APEX Integration
- Updated `apex/core/lmdb_mcp.py` to import from the external package
- Added missing methods (`cursor_scan`, `stat`) to the wrapper
- Maintained backward compatibility for all existing APEX code

### 4. Dependencies
- APEX now depends on `lmdb-mcp` as a local package
- Can be changed to PyPI dependency once published

## Architecture

```
APEX
├── src/apex/core/
│   ├── lmdb_mcp.py      # Wrapper importing from lmdb-mcp
│   └── memory.py         # APEX-specific memory patterns
└── lmdb-mcp/             # Standalone package
    └── src/lmdb_mcp/
        ├── core.py       # Core LMDB operations
        └── server.py     # MCP server

Direct LMDB usage in APEX:
- orchestration/session.py  # Session management
- orchestration/state.py    # State persistence
- orchestration/events.py   # Event storage
```

## Next Steps

1. **Publish to PyPI**:
   ```bash
   cd lmdb-mcp
   python -m build
   python -m twine upload dist/*
   ```

2. **Update APEX dependency**:
   Change in `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   # From:
   "lmdb-mcp @ file:///path/to/lmdb-mcp",
   # To:
   "lmdb-mcp>=0.1.0",
   ```

3. **Consider extracting orchestration LMDB usage**:
   The orchestration module still uses LMDB directly. This could potentially use lmdb-mcp as well, but it's not using MCP patterns.

## Testing

All tests pass with the extracted package:
- Core LMDB functionality ✓
- MCP server operations ✓
- APEX wrapper compatibility ✓
- Context manager support ✓

The package is ready for independent use and distribution.
