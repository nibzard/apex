## 🔄 Migration Guide for APEX Code

### For Existing Code (No Changes Needed)
```python
# This still works unchanged
from apex.core.memory import MemoryPatterns

memory = MemoryPatterns(apex_db)
task_id = await memory.create_task(project_id, task_data)
```

### For New Code (Enhanced API)
```python
# Use the enhanced API for new features
from apex.core.lmdb_mcp import APEXDatabase

async with APEXDatabase(workspace, project_id) as apex_db:
    task_id = await apex_db.create_task(task_data)
    issue_id = await apex_db.report_issue(issue_data)
    await apex_db.update_agent_status("coder", status_data)
```

### For ProcessOrchestrator (Seamless)
```python
# ProcessOrchestrator continues to work as before
class ProcessOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, memory_patterns: MemoryPatterns):
        self.memory = memory_patterns  # Uses plugin system underneath
```
