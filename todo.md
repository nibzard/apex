# APEX v2.0 Development Task List - The Orchestrator-Worker Architecture

This roadmap reflects the **v2.0 Orchestrator-Worker Architecture** from [`specs.md`](specs.md). The new paradigm focuses on a single persistent **Supervisor** that orchestrates ephemeral **Workers** and deterministic **Utilities** via a shared LMDB world state.

## **v2.0 Architecture Paradigm Shift**

### **From Multi-Agent Team ‚Üí Orchestrator-Worker System**
- ‚ùå **Old Model**: Three equal agents (Supervisor, Coder, Adversary) in conversation
- ‚úÖ **New Model**: One persistent Supervisor + ephemeral Workers + deterministic Utilities

### **Core Principles**
1. **Orchestration over Emulation** - AI-native control plane, not human team simulation
2. **Intelligent Dispatch** - Smart task routing: creative tasks ‚Üí Workers, deterministic tasks ‚Üí Utilities
3. **Context-as-a-Service** - Large data stays in LMDB, agents work with pointers
4. **Tiered Execution** - Layered trust and capability model

### **Key Components**
- **üß† Supervisor**: Persistent meta-agent managing project lifecycle
- **‚öôÔ∏è Workers**: Ephemeral Claude CLI processes for single tasks
- **üîß Utilities**: Python scripts for deterministic operations
- **üóÑÔ∏è World State**: LMDB shared memory with TaskBriefing API
