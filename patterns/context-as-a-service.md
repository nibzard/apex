## Problem
AI agents working on large codebases or complex projects often need access to massive amounts of context that exceed token limits or memory constraints. Loading entire codebases into context is inefficient and often impossible. Traditional approaches either truncate important information or fail entirely when content is too large. Agents need intelligent access to relevant context without overwhelming their working memory.

## Solution
Implement a service layer that manages large content through chunking, indexing, and pointer-based access. The APEX v2.0 pattern provides Context-as-a-Service (CaaS) through:

- **Content Chunking**: Break large documents, codebases, or datasets into manageable pieces
- **Pointer-Based Access**: Use lightweight references instead of full content in agent prompts
- **Smart Summarization**: Generate summaries and abstracts for quick context understanding
- **On-Demand Loading**: Fetch specific content chunks only when needed by agents
- **Context Optimization**: Dynamically select most relevant content for current tasks
- **Memory-Efficient Storage**: Store large content outside agent memory while maintaining accessibility

Key service capabilities:
- **Intelligent Indexing**: Semantic and structural indexing for efficient content retrieval
- **Context Synthesis**: Combine multiple content sources into coherent context
- **Priority-Based Loading**: Load most important content first based on task relevance
- **Version Management**: Handle different versions of large content artifacts

## Example (context service architecture)
```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Agent Layer"
        A1[Agent 1]
        A2[Agent 2]
        A3[Agent 3]
    end

    subgraph "Context-as-a-Service"
        CS[Context Service]
        CI[Content Indexer]
        CC[Content Chunker]
        CSM[Context Summarizer]
    end

    subgraph "Storage Layer"
        CB[(Content Blocks)]
        CM[(Content Metadata)]
        CI_Store[(Content Index)]
    end

    A1 -->|Request: "Show auth code"| CS
    A2 -->|Request: "Get test files"| CS
    A3 -->|Pointer: chunk_789| CS

    CS --> CI
    CS --> CC
    CS --> CSM

    CI --> CI_Store
    CC --> CB
    CSM --> CM

    CS -.->|Optimized Context| A1
    CS -.->|Relevant Chunks| A2
    CS -.->|Full Content| A3
```

## How to use it
- **Content Analysis**: Analyze large content to identify natural chunk boundaries and relationships
- **Index Strategy**: Create semantic and structural indexes for efficient content discovery
- **Pointer Management**: Design lightweight pointer system that agents can use naturally
- **Caching Layer**: Implement intelligent caching of frequently accessed content
- **Context Optimization**: Use heuristics to determine optimal context for each agent task

## Context Service API Example
```python
# Agent requests context through service
context_request = {
    "agent_id": "coder_agent_1",
    "task": "implement_authentication",
    "content_types": ["source_code", "documentation", "tests"],
    "priority": ["current_task", "related_modules", "dependencies"],
    "max_tokens": 4000
}

# Service returns optimized context
context_response = {
    "context_summary": "Authentication module with JWT implementation...",
    "content_chunks": [
        {
            "pointer": "chunk_auth_core_123",
            "type": "source_code",
            "summary": "Core authentication logic",
            "relevance_score": 0.95,
            "full_content": "class AuthService: ..."
        },
        {
            "pointer": "chunk_auth_tests_456",
            "type": "test_code",
            "summary": "Authentication test cases",
            "relevance_score": 0.87,
            "summary_only": true  # Full content available on demand
        }
    ],
    "related_pointers": ["chunk_user_model_789", "chunk_jwt_utils_012"]
}
```

## Trade-offs
- **Pros:**
    - Enables work with arbitrarily large content without token limit issues
    - Reduces memory usage through intelligent content selection
    - Provides consistent interface for content access across agents
    - Allows for sophisticated content optimization and caching
    - Scales to handle massive codebases and datasets
- **Cons/Considerations:**
    - Additional complexity in content management and indexing
    - Latency from content chunking and retrieval operations
    - Risk of losing important context through summarization
    - Requires sophisticated relevance algorithms for content selection
    - Potential inconsistency if content changes during processing
